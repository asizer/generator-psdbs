# generator-starter-map 

_Nota bene: This is not actually a registered npm package yet. You will have to download it and use `npm link` (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)_

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1714870?v=3&s=200)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
npm install -g yo
```

You will also need to install grunt globally (read more about grunt [here](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)).

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-starter-map from npm, run:

```
npm install -g generator-starter-map
```

Finally, create a folder where your new project will live, and run the generator:

```
yo starter-map
```
